## Interview Questions & Answers

### How will you continue learning about computer science?
I believe in lifelong learning. The education system is put in place to give us a base set of knowledge and learning strategies, but it is up to us to decide how we want to use what was provided to us. Especially in the study of computer science, there are so many paths to take and varying fields of interest. Computer science as a whole is constantly evolving, with the introduction of new languages, more performant hardware and emerging technology.

Personally, I am still undecided on what specific field I will go in to, but I do know that the study of computer science captivates me. I've had experience in game development, front-end web development, UI design and more. I've worked with C++, C#, JS, HTML, CSS, & Python, and I look to experiment with more languages. I want to build an app for IOS at some point, so perhaps I will start learning Objective-C, or the more modern Swift. That's the beauty of computer science- the fluidity of each language, program, project, all connected in some way, similar to the internet itself. Another field of study that I am interested in leaning about is AI and machine learning. As deep learning is becoming more and more relevant, I believe that one day it could be the foundation of some industrial and even societal practices.
### What does it mean to have good programming practices?
Coding is freeform- there are many ways to get to the same solution. However, some of these ways are more efficient, effective and clear. To have good programming practices, there are many points to remember. However, some of the factors of clean code are opinion based, so it is impossible to satisfy everyone. Here are some of the most important rules to follow:
* #### Write comments and documentation: #### sussy! sus! imposter!
* 

### How does version control(github) allow you to learn more about coding principles?
