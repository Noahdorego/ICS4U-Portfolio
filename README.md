## Interview Questions & Answers

### How will you continue learning about computer science?
I believe in lifelong learning. The education system is put in place to give us a base set of knowledge and learning strategies, but it is up to us to decide how we want to use what was provided to us. Especially in the study of computer science, there are so many paths to take and varying fields of interest. Computer science as a whole is constantly evolving, with the introduction of new languages, more performant hardware and emerging technology.

Personally, I am still undecided on what specific field I will go in to, but I do know that the study of computer science captivates me. I've had experience in game development, front-end web development, UI design and more. I've worked with C++, C#, JS, HTML, CSS, & Python, and I look to experiment with more languages. I want to build an app for IOS at some point, so perhaps I will start learning Objective-C, or the more modern Swift. That's the beauty of computer science- the fluidity of each language, program, project, all connected in some way, similar to the internet itself. Another field of study that I am interested in leaning about is AI and machine learning. As deep learning is becoming more and more relevant, I believe that one day it could be the foundation of some industrial and even societal practices.

### What does it mean to have good programming practices?
Coding is freeform- there are many ways to get to the same solution. However, some of these ways are more efficient, effective and clear. To have good programming practices, there are many points to remember. However, some of the factors of clean code are opinion based, so it is impossible to satisfy everyone. Here are some of the most important rules to follow:
* __Write Comments and Documentation:__ This is one of the first things you are taught as a programmer. Sure, some of your programs will be simple enough to read without comments when you begin to code, but it is a good habit to develop. As you make larger and more complex programs, you will need to use comments to help other people understand your code, and even to help yourself remember. Comments are the main form of documentation that we are taught, but there are many other aspects of it: file organization/naming, naming conventions, citations, links, etc. The purpose of documentation is to make the code easily readable and comprehendable.
* __Learn How to Debug Effectively:__ I think it is safe to safe that debugging is one of the most used skills among programmers, so it is important to learn how to do it well to save your time. There are many ways to solve an issue: work backwards, explain the problem out loud, comment out parts of the code, get others to look at it- those are just some of the ways to help smoothen the process. Nothing is guaranteed when debugging, which is good and bad at the same time.
* __Save & Backup Your Work Often:__ No explanation is really necessary. Anything can suddenly happen: be it a glitch, a crash, a power outage, a wild deer smashing through a window and destroying your device, etc. Therefore, it is imperative that you save often, and make backups for your files and projects. 

Of course, there are many [more ways to improve your programming practices](https://www.aversan.com/coding-standards-and-best-practices-2/), but these (in my opinion) are the most important at a student level.
