    <div class="w3-justify">
    <p>I am Noah do Rego, a student in my final year of highschool at A.Y. Jackson. I've been interested in coding and computer science ever since I was 10 years old.
      I started with block-based coding on Scratch, but have expanded my knowledge by trying many different languages, including <strong>C++, C#, JS, HTML, CSS, Python, 
      and more.</strong> I am interested in game development, UI/UX design, web development and mobile development. </p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing sports, working on personal projects and playing video games. Recently, I've been hooked on a game called Rocket League, 
      an easy to pick up yet hard to master car-soccer hybrid.</p></div>

    <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>Throughout the course, I've worked on many projects. A large part of my learning was focused on Khan Academy, which is an intuitive, immersive platform.
    However, I also experimented with other platforms- I worked with Javascript on Codecademy, and began the machine learning certification on FreeCodeCamp, but
    could not complete a project due to time constraints. Another resource that I used is the p5.js web editor, which helped me display my projects outside of Khan
    Academy and served as a tool in the coding challenge presentation. I plan on continuing to use these resources in my spare time to develop my coding skills and
    create projects of varying complexity to add to my personal portfolio.<br>[If the Khan Academy projects aren't loading properly, open them in a new tab]<br></p></div>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>Natural Simulations was a very eye-opening module for me. It displayed examples of the vital connection between 
      math and coding. Specifically, learning about vectors and forces helped me understand how realism can be added to games/simulations. The whole module was advanced: nothing was "dumbed down" or explained for children. 
      It felt like a real step in my future of coding.</p></div>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>I completed the entire AP Computer Science Priciples course, and I'm glad I did. Outside of coding, 
      I also want to know exactly <i>how</i> the digital world works. This course provided me with the base knowledge I need in several topics, and each unit was relevant.</p></div>
      <img src="images/APCS_Sections.png" style="width:100%;max-width:800px" class="w3-margin-top">
      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>The two units which I appreciated the most are Digital Information and The Internet. Digital Information 
      helped me understand how data is stored and transferred, and what formats are most effective. The Internet showed me the basics of networks, transporting packets and 
      web protocols, which I wanted to know. This was a super useful course for me.</p></div>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>I've completed and recompleted this module 3 times. Yet, each time teaches me something new or solidifies 
      a coding concept in my head. The initial part of the module is review, as the basics are taught, but I focused on the object-oriented part of the module. OOP is a very 
      efficient way of coding, if it is implemented correctly. This module gave me the chance to improve my knowledge and skills in the subject. I learned about object inheritance, 
      classes, attributes and more. I will continue learning about OOP in the future, as it is an important concept to know.</p></div>

    <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>Since I have experience in game development, this was a perfect module for me. I learned about game mechanics, 
    scenes, movement and more. It also expanded on the object oriented programming, which allowed me to practice with it.</p></div>

      <img src="images/codecademy_progress.png" style="width:100%;max-width:700px" class="w3-margin-top">
      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>This was the skill path I chose to do in Codecademy. There were many that I was interested in, but I chose 
      this one to make basic JS concepts more concrete in my head. However, I used this module to observe how Codecademy teaches and see if I'd want to continue using the platform. 
      I can say with confidence that I will use Codecademy in my future, as it demonstrates an effective method of teaching, and introduces you to coding in the real world.</p></div>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>This was a good refresher on HTML and CSS. It helped me to develop better practices and use 
      different features.</p></div>

    <div id="7" class="w3-container menu w3-center w3-light-grey w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h2>HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive</h2>

      <div class="w3-justify w3-content" style="max-width:700px"><p>This was useful because it introduced something that I had never even heard of, the DOM. 
      The Document Object Model represents the document in objects and nodes, and allows you to make dynamic changes to the program in real time. This is 
      something that I want to learn more about, as it is a side of JS that I've never seen.</p></div>

    </a>The challenge was inspired by Dan Shiffman's Coding Train videos. We coded from one of his videos, refactored it, and then presented to the class.</p></div>

    The presentation was a great opportunity to see how I would perform in a live setting, and also helped me practice my presentation skills. I seeked to interact 
    with the audience to make it more engaging, but that was a bit difficult. Overall, it went well and I'm happy with how it turned out.</p></div>

      another piece is eaten. However, since an infinite loop could be created, I cut of the program at a score of 100,000. I also tried to expand the canvas to 
      simulate the real game, but it didn't turn out very clean. I settled with randomizing the colours instead.</p></div>
